What this Package Includes?
----------------------------
The main contributions of this package are:

1) ``State-of-the-art Algorithms`` - A sheer amount of existing state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding algorithms (such as TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, TransM, KG2E, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEX, ConvE, ProjE, RotatE, SME, SLM, NTN, TuckER) is presented in the library.
2) ``Bayesian hyper-parameter tuning`` - Module that supports automatic hyperparameter tuning using bayesian optimization.
3) ``Optimized Implementation`` - Optimized performance by making a proper use of CPUs and GPUs (multiprocess and Tensorflow).
4) ``Visualization and Summary`` - A suite of visualization and summary tools.
