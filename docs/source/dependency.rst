The goal of this library is to minimize the dependency on other libraries
as far as possible to rapidly test the algorithms against different dataset.
We emphasize that in the beginning, we will not be focusing in run-time performance.
However, in the future, may provide faster implementation of each of the algorithms.
We encourage installing the tensorflow-gpu version for optimal usage. For optimal usage
we suggest to install the library with python3.6.

You will need following to be installed for the pykg2vec library:

* tensorflow==`<version suitable for your workspace>`
* networkx>=2.2
* setuptools>=40.8.0
* matplotlib>=3.0.3
* numpy>=1.16.2
* seaborn>=0.9.0
* scikit_learn>=0.20.3
* hyperopt>=0.1.2
* progressbar2>=3.39.3
* pathlib>=1.0.1
* pandas>=0.24.2

In order to run the test cases, you need:

* pytest
